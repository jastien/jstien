            At the dawn of Western Typography

        <p>
            It was in the 15th century, when the first types, fonts and typefaces appeared. However, the design or appearance of letters had been evolving during many centuries before. The first typefaces appeared in Europe, such as D-K type (around 1455) for the
            first book printed in Europe. It had distinct gothic blackletter traits. The font is called Bensch Gothic font can now be used to show how those first fonts of Western typography looked like. Later in Italy new typefaces were presented: Bastarda,
            fraktur, rotunda, and Schwabacher. Those typefaces featured distinctive professional design with structurized and highly organized glyphs and the computer fonts Stonehenge Regular, Breitkopf Fraktur, Typographer Rotunda, and Schwabacher mimic
            the appearance of the mentioned medieval typefaces.

            Typography during the Renaissance
        </div>

        <p>"Cursiva humanistica" is a known style of writing from the Renaissance. The slanted glyphs design gave birth to a wide range of Italic or cursive typefaces. Claude Garamond developed the typefaces, known as "Canon de Garamond" and "Petit Canon
            de Garamond", which became the prototype for modern Garamond style fonts, such as Apple Garamond, SGaramond Regular.

            Transition to Modern Style
        </div>
        <p>
            New trends in Western typography were introduces in the 17th and 18th century: the contrast between thick and thin strokes, and bracketed serifs turned into fine almost straight lines. William Caslon, Johann Fleischmann, and John Baskerville made notable
            contributions to the development of the Roman typefaces. Caslon-Bold, Dustismo Roman Bold, Sanskrit Roman Bold Italic fonts inherit the best traits of this particular tradition in western typography.

            Modern days of Western Typography
        </div>
        <p>Typography was popularized over a wide range of applications from newspapers to posters and advertisings after the invention of lithography in 1796. A new round of western typography has begun with the appearance of personal computers at the end
            of the 20th century. A new font or typeface can be designed in a relatively easy way with the help of specialized computer applications or font editors. Every user of personal computer use computer fonts, which gave the push to the appearance
            of the big free font repositories online.
