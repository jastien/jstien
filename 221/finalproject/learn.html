                            Some rules are necessary to know but very complex and technical. So it's best to include just the most important parts of them when getting together basic rules. For full details of rugby rules, follow this link to the <a target="_blank"

                            Dimensions. Rugby league is played on a field 112 - 122 by 68 metres (122.5 - 133.4 x 74.3 yards). The longer boundary lines are touch lines, while the shorter boundary lines are dead ball lines. The touch lines and dead ball lines are out of play.

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Rugby is a team sport that delivers significant social and health benefits. It can also be a physically demanding sport and players should be physically and mentally prepared, and understand how to play safely. It is the responsibility of all - players,
                            coaches and parents - to ensure that a positive, safe, enjoyable environment is created where ALL players will be able to reach their fullest potential, and that - whatever form of the game you play - the training and education
                            materials and equipment are there to support everyone in creating that environment.

                    <div>
                        <p>

                            In 2009 the World Rugby member unions identified integrity, passion, solidarity, discipline and respect as the defining character-building characteristics of rugby. These are now collectively known as the World Rugby values and are incorporated within
                            the World Rugby Playing Charter, a guiding document aimed at preserving rugby's unique character and ethos both on and off the field of play. The core values enable participants immediately to understand the character of the
                            games and what makes it distinctive as a sport which is played by people of all shapes and sizes.
